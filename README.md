# A/B-Testing-project

## Summary
We were introduced to the principles and statistics behind A/B-Testing, revised terminology and learned about the different tests and when to make use of them. Finally we applied our learnings with fictitious data on 4 different versions a web page.

## Languages and Libraries Used
In a Google Colab notebook we imported the pandas and numpy library to be able to perform statistical calculations.

## Key Learnings
A lot of what we touched upon was new for me, but I'd go with the concept of the Central Limit Theorem, the calculation of t-sample- and chi-square-tests. No gut feeling, only rational-statistical proof, whether our observations rightly call for action or mislead us.

## Challenges Overcame
After coding for the most part of our bootcamp, this chapter consisted of mainly theory and formulas and concepts needed some extra time to be grasped entirely. Visualizations in graphs helped make some results more tangible.

## Additional Reflections
It was somewhat surprising to see that changes on websites are under such scrutiny, I imagined it to be more of an trial-and-error approached mostly led by subjective design preferences. But then as I also learned in the Linked Learning Course on "The Data Science of Experimental Design" this would  subject us to mere erratic design choices.
